# Devops Bookmarks

Welcome to DevOpsBookmarks, home of https://www.devopsbookmarks.org. This is a fork of the original www.devopsbookmarks.com: https://github.com/devopsbookmarks/devopsbookmarks.com; however, we've decided to maintain this as the original site is down.

> To discover tools in the devops landscape.

There are new awesome tools and frameworks being released everyday.
This is an open and transparent attempt at aggregating all these tools
and frameworks.
